So how do we record on Zoom when we're doing like a training or a webinar and not have all the other people on screen? And of course I have all these other people on screen right now. So thank you to Leah and Shay and Gregory and Eric for being here and kind of doing this demo with me. So as you can see right now we're in what's called gallery view. And so what you should do is I'm going to show you right now I'm moving my mouse. I'm clicking on myself and I'm clicking spotlight for everyone or spotlight or you know yes. So now what's happening is those of you who were watching this video can see that I'm on the big screen. It says remove spotlight on the top left. I'm not going to click it because I am spotlighter right now. I don't want to remove myself. And what happens is when I start recording on Zoom it's only going to record me and not the little strip of videos that you all see at the top with Shay, Eric, Leah and Gregory. Now if I click on view on the top right you can see that I'm in speaker view. So that might be a good double check you know make sure you're in the large window. No one else is the same size window as you and click on view on the top right. Sorry top right and that your speaker view. Now if I click gallery view so for example let's say that it's a kind of a training where I do want to bring in some of the other participants to speak. I could I have two choices. A lot of times people go ahead and just do the gallery view and even though only me and only the speaker and one other person speaking. Everyone else is being seen which is not you know it doesn't feel comfortable for both the viewer and the people there they're not sure they're. So the way to do it is to keep it on speaker view and then when someone is going to be speaking alongside you you add them to the spotlight. So for example I'm going to do that with you know with with Leah right now. Okay so I'm just going to click on layers video and I'm going to click at spotlight and you can see now that Leah and I have the same sized video. And yes Leah and thank you and then but of course you could see on the on on layers video that her mic is still muted. There's that red icon so I would I would I could click on basically move on mouse over her and click on ask to unmute and then she will get a prompt and then she will be able to unmute and Leah you can show us real quick. What that looks and sounds like yeah and you know so interestingly as you'll notice the mute icon took a little while to disappear but she was still able to speak. But now you can see my move my mouse over her it says mute instead of ask to unmute so I'm going to mute her back and I'm going to remove her from the spotlight so that I'm this I'm still the only one on the screen. So I click on her I click remove spotlight and there we are now we're back to to just me on the screen. So just I guess the main key is if you're doing a training or webinar as you know you want to keep it on speaker view and spotlight yourself and don't go into gallery view unless everyone in the gallery view is really comfortable with being recorded on video. So I hope this helps. Thanks.
